# Portfolio

This is a small sample of projects I've worked on over the years, be it on my own or in the context of courses.

## N-body problem

This simulates N particles interacting gravitationally. It is optimized using Fast Fourier Transforms to make what appears to be a O(n^2) problem into a O(nlogn) one, allowing this simulation of up to millions of particles. Of particular interest is the 2_particles.mp4 file, which shows two particles in orbit, and the file periodic.mp4, which shows galaxy formations with a million bodies.

## Housing prices

This is a machine learning project making use of this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques. It predicts housing prices with two different models: a neural network made with TensorFlow, as well as a random forest model.

## FRB public Webpage

A website I have worked on while I was doing research in the CHIME/FRB collaboration. It can be seen here: https://www.chime-frb.ca/. While some of the appearance of the website has changed since I worked on it, all the logic and organisation of database display was done by me.
